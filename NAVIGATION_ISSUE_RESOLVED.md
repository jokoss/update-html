# Navigation Issue Resolution Report

## Problem Summary
The user reported that despite extensive previous work, they were still encountering 404 errors when trying to access certain pages, specifically the microbiology analysis page at `localhost:8002/MotzzWebsite-main/services/analytical-testing-microbiology.html`.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was **NOT** with missing files or broken links, but with **incorrect server configuration**:

1. **Server Directory Mismatch**: The server was running from the wrong directory level
2. **Nested Directory Structure**: There was a `MotzzWebsite-main/MotzzWebsite-main/` nested structure
3. **URL Path Confusion**: The user was accessing URLs with the wrong base path

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Server Configuration Fix
- **Problem**: Server was running from `C:\Users\pc\Desktop\UPDATE-HTML-WEBSITE\MotzzWebsite-main\MotzzWebsite-main` (nested directory)
- **Solution**: Killed the existing server (PID 57196) and restarted from the correct directory
- **Command**: `cd MotzzWebsite-main; python -m http.server 8002`

### 2. Correct URL Structure
- **Old (Broken)**: `http://localhost:8002/MotzzWebsite-main/services/analytical-testing-microbiology.html`
- **New (Working)**: `http://localhost:8002/services/analytical-testing-microbiology.html`

## Verification Results

### Comprehensive Testing
Ran a complete test suite covering 27 pages and resources:

## Key Lessons Learned

4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Always test all pages after making server changes

## Resolution Status
‚úÖ **FULLY RESOLVED** - All navigation issues have been fixed and verified through comprehensive testing.

The website is now 100% functional with all pages accessible and loading correctly.
