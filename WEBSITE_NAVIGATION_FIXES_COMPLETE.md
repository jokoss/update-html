- Verified fixes with pattern matching and validation

### 3. Live Testing
- Set up local development server
- Tested key pages across different directory levels
- Verified asset loading through server logs
- Confirmed visual rendering and functionality

## Files Modified

### Main Fix Scripts Created:
- `fix_all_pages_systematically.py` - Comprehensive page-by-page fixes

- **Services**: All service pages and agriculture subdirectory
- **Subdirectories**: about-us/, contact-us/, forms/, laboratorytesting/, sampling/
- **Sampling Info**: All sampling information pages

## Server Logs Verification
All tested pages show successful asset loading:
